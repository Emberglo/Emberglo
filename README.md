<h1 style="color:#e09954;">Hi there, I'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p>
   I'm currently a student at CodeWorks in Boise, Idaho working towards a career in software development.<br>
   I have a background in Wildlife Biology, but worked in retail management for 10 years before taking the plunge and learning development. I have always had a creative streak    which usually takes the form of wildlife photography. <br>
   Ever since I was a child, I loved taking things apart to figure out how they worked. I still do this as an adult, but I have gotten a little better about putting them          back together again! This natural creativity and curiosity both lend themselves to software development. My primary interest as a developer is creating beautiful and            functional user experiences. <br>
   I'm proficient in working with HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, jQuery, and Vue on the front end.<br>
   On the back end, I primarily use NodeJS with Express and MongoDB with Mongoose.<br>
   I am currently learning to use C#, .Net, and mySQL.
